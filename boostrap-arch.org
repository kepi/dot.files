Install packages I'm using on /Arch Linux/.

This is just quick script to get what I need until I find some better way. I was
considering /Ansible/, but it seems too heavy, especially when there are no native
AUR modules.

Worst is this isn't idempotent yet.

* TODO Convert to Ansible?
Looks like I'll be moving to Ansible anyway. And maybe find something cleaner
then yupfiles to install things.

* Prerequisities
#+begin_src sh :tangle no
sudo pacman -S base-devel git rsync
#+end_src

* Install termite terminfo entry
#+begin_src sh
[ -f /usr/share/terminfo/t/termite ] || (cd /tmp && wget -q https://raw.githubusercontent.com/thestinger/termite/master/termite.terminfo && tic -x termite.terminfo; /bin/rm termite.terminfo)
#+end_src

* Install Yup
I'm using [[https://github.com/ericm/yup][Yup]] to install packages on Arch.

#+begin_src sh
if [ ! $(which yup) ]; then
  cd /tmp
  git clone https://aur.archlinux.org/yup-bin.git
  cd yup-bin
  makepkg -si
fi  
#+end_src

* Yupfile
No when /Yup/ is installed I can install software from /Yupfiles/.

I'll try to create one /Yupfile/ for every configuration which need to install
something in =etc/yupfiles/xxx.yup= and then install from there.

#+begin_src sh
cat etc/yupfiles/*.yup | sed 's/#.*$//;/^$/d' > etc/yupfile
yup -Y etc/yupfile
#+end_src

** Chezmoi
#+begin_src conf :tangle etc/yupfiles/chezmoi.yup
chezmoi latest noaur
#+end_src
