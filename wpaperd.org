[[https://github.com/danyspin97/wpaperd][wpaperd]] is the modern wallpaper daemon for Wayland. It dynamically changes the
current wallpaper, either after a certain amount of time or via a command-line
interface. It uses OpenGL ES to render the images and have beautiful
hardware-accelerated transitions, while being easy on resources.

When switching to /Niri/, i realized I'll have to use some wallpaper tool.
Swaybg would work fine, but why not try something little fancier?

* TODO Not working as I need yet
- description doesn't work on Niri (I opened https://github.com/danyspin97/wpaperd/issues/155)
- [X] default isn't fallback probably, which is weird. (FIXED - [any] do this)
