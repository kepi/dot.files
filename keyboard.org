#+TITLE: Keyboard

I'm using [[https://github.com/kepi/cus_klaveska][ČUS Kláveska]] as may keyboard layout. Setting is done through =localectl=
in Arch it seems, so no config file?

#+begin_src sh
sudo localectl set-keymap cus_klaveska ralt_switch,terminate:ctrl_alt_bksp,grp_led:scroll,ctrl:nocaps
sudo localectl set-x11-keymap cus_klaveska ralt_switch,terminate:ctrl_alt_bksp,grp_led:scroll,ctrl:nocaps
#+end_src

* TODO Move this to Ansible
As this need to be done manually now, it would be better to install my keyboard
and set it up from Ansible.
