#+TITLE: Arch Linux
#+PROPERTY: header-args:yaml :mkdirp yes :tangle ansible/arch.yml :tangle_preserver

System-wide settings can't be easily handled with Chezmoi. And more importantly,
we don't need only config files but other tasks too. Ansible is just the tool
for the job.

* Running
** On localhost
#+begin_src sh
ansible-playbook -c local -i localhost, ansible/arch.yml
#+end_src

** On different system
I.e. when preparing new laptop sitting at 192.168.1.123 (you must be able to SSH
and use sudo there):

#+begin_src sh
ansible-playbook -i 192.168.1.123, ansible/arch.yml
#+end_src

For more options (different user, no sudo etc just check [[https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/playbooks.html][Working With Playbooks
â€” Ansible Documentation]]).

** On localhost and multiple systems
I want to setup all my machines at once, so I just added my SSH key even to
local machine and calling Ansible like this:

#+begin_src sh :results drawer :export both
ansible-playbook -i localhost,midget, ansible/arch.yml
#+end_src

* Faillock - banning after failed logins
For me its pretty uncomfortable to be locked out after 3 failed logins for 10
minutes, which is Arch's default these days. But, its not completely stupid to
limit the attempts.

#+begin_src yaml
# indent hack
    - name: Ban after 10 failed attempts
      lineinfile:
        path: /etc/security/faillock.conf
        regexp: "^#? *deny *="
        line: "deny = 10"

    - name: Ban for 5 minutes only
      lineinfile:
        path: /etc/security/faillock.conf
        regexp: "^#? *unlock_time *="
        line: "unlock_time = 300"
#+end_src
