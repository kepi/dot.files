/Password store/ and it's alternative /Gopass/ are nice cmdline password managers.

I'm mostly using /Gopass/ as it makes it easier to share some password stores in
teams and provide some other goodies. Unfortunately I'm not sure if it will be
viable solution for future, as /Gopass/ team decided to focus on core features.
And are slowly removing exactly those futures which made me to chose it in the
first place (as i.e. YAML metadata for every password).
